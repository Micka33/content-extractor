{"name":"Content-extractor","tagline":"Extract meaningful content from pdf and psd file, such as texts and images both linked into a common JSON string","body":"content-extractor\r\n=================\r\n\r\nContent-extractor is python based project. The only reason to this is the availability of the librairies. (The best ones are in python IMO)\r\nCurrently, this project parse pdf and psd file to extract meaningful content, such as texts and images both linked under a common json string\r\n\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n=================\r\n\r\nContent-extractor is build upon the followings:\r\n\r\n- [psd-tools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psd-tools/) To extract images and text from psd files\r\n- [pdfminer](http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/pdfminer/#intro) To extract text from pdf files as xml\r\n- [beautiful soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) To convert the extracted xml as json\r\n- [pdfimages](http://ubuntugenius.wordpress.com/2012/02/04/how-to-extract-images-from-pdf-documents-in-ubuntulinux/) (from poppler-utils) To extract images from pdf files as image.ppm\r\n- [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) To convert the ppm images to png\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n=================\r\n\r\nSince there is a lot of dependencies and most of them also have their own dependencies, I have made a shellscript to simplify the installation process.\r\n\r\nThe script assume the following:\r\n\r\n - If you don't have [apt-get](http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/apt-get), then you should have [brew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/).\r\n - You have [curl](http://pwet.fr/man/linux/commandes/curl) installed (the shell executable, not the php module).\r\n - You have [python 2.7.x](http://www.python.org/download/) installed on your system.\r\n - You have [unzip](http://www.info-zip.org/mans/unzip.html) installed on your system.\r\n\r\nWhen you launch the script, it's installing [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip), if it isn't already present on your system.\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\n$ cd install\r\n$ sh install.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow to use it\r\n=================\r\n\r\nFor any extension (currently pdf/psd) you can use `parser.py [file_path] [image_path]` it will automaticaly do the job.\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n#Will write a metada.json and extract the images into the folder images\r\n./parser.py psdtools/work.psd './images/'\r\n./parser.py pdfreader/book.pdf './images/'\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also import parser.py into your own python project and use it the folowing way:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n#will return a string containing the json and extract the images into the folder images\r\nfrom parser import parser\r\njson = parser.parse(\"psdtools/work.psd\", \"./images/\")\r\njson = parser.parse(\"pdfreader/book.pdf\", \"./images/\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also use the pdfreader and psdtools script independently doing so:\r\n\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\n# Shell:\r\n$ ./psdtools/main.py psdtools/work.psd './images/'\r\n$ ./pdfreader/main.py pdfreader/book.pdf './images/'\r\n```\r\n```Python\r\n# Python:\r\n# PSD\r\nfrom psdtools import main\r\njson = main.run(\"psdtools/work.psd\", \"./images/\")\r\n# PDF\r\nfrom pdfreader import main\r\njson = main.run(\"pdfreader/book.pdf\", \"./images/\")\r\njson = main.run(\"pdfreader/book.pdf\", \"./images/\", \"ppm\") #will extract the images as ppm/pbm ad then convert them as png\r\njson = main.run(\"pdfreader/book.pdf\", \"./images/\", \"jpeg\") #default: will extract the images directly as jpg\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n./pdfreader/main.py is just a simplified interface to the very powerful pdfreader/util/convert.py, I have rewrite convert.py to be a class, but this is originally [pdf2txt.py](http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/pdfminer/#pdf2txt) from [pdfminer](http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/pdfminer/index.html).\r\nHowever, you can still use convert.py as if it was the originial [pdf2txt.py](http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/pdfminer/index.html#pdf2txt) tool, [here is the documentation](http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/pdfminer/index.html#pdf2txt).\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\n$ pdfreader/util/convert.py -o output.html samples/naacl06-shinyama.pdf\r\n(extract text as an HTML file whose filename is output.html)\r\n\r\n$ pdfreader/util/convert.py -V -c euc-jp -o output.html samples/jo.pdf\r\n(extract a Japanese HTML file in vertical writing, CMap is required)\r\n\r\n$ pdfreader/util/convert.py -P mypassword -o output.txt secret.pdf\r\n(extract a text from an encrypted PDF file)\r\n```\r\n\r\nconvert.py can also be imported in a python project (but less options are available due to my lack of implementation)\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n# @see pdfreader/main.py:text_to_dict as example\r\nfrom util.convert import converter\r\nconvert = converter()\r\nxml = convert.as_xml().add_input_file(fileinput).run()\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow does it work\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThe information are extracted having in mind to keep the parent-child relations.\r\n\r\n - For a pdf file:\r\n    - A pdf file can have many pages, and so the json string goes. each page has many images and many paragraphs.\r\n    - Each paragraph has a width, height, a content(string), a y and x position, a font, and a font size.\r\n    - For a pdf file the original image name can't be extracted so the images are name like the followong [uniqId]_p[pageNumber].png. uniqId is a unique Id, pageNumber is the page in which the images is contained. you shouldn't need to use this information since the json string contains it.\r\n\r\n - For a psd file:\r\n    - A psd file can have many groups which are translated in pages into the json string. each group in a psd file can have many layers, a layer can be either text(paragraphs) or an image(images).\r\n    - Each text layer has a width, height, a content(string), a y and x position. The font and font size are currenlty not extracted (because psd-tools doesn't do it).\r\n    - For a psd file the image is name with the layer name it come from, but since many layers can have the same name the following is applied to be sure we have a unique name. [uniqId]_[layerName]_[groupName].png.\r\n\r\n - PSD files:\r\n   - Text: Because of the psd-tools library, you can't know the font, bold, italic, underline attribute.\r\n\r\n - PDF files:\r\n   - Text: Because of the pdfminer library, you can't have many fonts in the same paragraph. It is also not possible to extract the underlines. However the bold and italic attribute are extracted as html and directly integrated into the string.\r\n\r\nYou can see under a simplified example taken out from book.pdf of how look the json string.\r\n\r\nJSON Format (from pdfreader/book.pdf 'simplified')\r\n=================\r\n\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n    \"pages\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"images\": [\r\n                \"961dfcc0-c1eb-11e2-92af-040ccedc7e34_p0.png\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"paragraphs\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"size\": 98,\r\n                    \"width\": 587,\r\n                    \"string\": \"Book Title\",\r\n                    \"y\": -98,\r\n                    \"x\": -324,\r\n                    \"font\": \"Georgia\",\r\n                    \"height\": 705\r\n                }\r\n            ]\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"images\": [\r\n                \"96f4e9ee-c1eb-11e2-ad2b-040ccedc7e34_p1.png\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"paragraphs\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"size\": 24,\r\n                    \"width\": 138,\r\n                    \"string\": \"CHAPTER 1\",\r\n                    \"y\": -24,\r\n                    \"x\": -88,\r\n                    \"font\": \"Georgia\",\r\n                    \"height\": 711\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"size\": 33,\r\n                    \"width\": 489,\r\n                    \"string\": \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur \\n<i>adipisicing</i> <b>elit, sed</b> <i><b>do eiusmod</i></b>\\ntempor incididunt ut labore et dolore \\nmagna aliqua.
